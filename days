*If it does not have a return keyword its not a 
 function its procedure.

*When I was studying 9th class my math teacher taught
 me that in a function each element in a domain could
 be mapped to only one value in range. I could not
 understand why. But now the same thing is what I learn
 in FP. And the reason I feel is it makes debugging
 obvious. Else I would have to go into function and 
 see which one will be returned.

* I love to get back my childhood brain. Because back
  then when I saw fogoh(x) it was beautiful and I owned
  it. But now I think from an external perpective.

* More than side effects etc FP is nothing but being
  obvious. When you look at the function you need to
  be like , OK this does this and this will be the ouput
  And currying and Partial application proves that.
  Because in currying the inner function uses the variable
  passed by the outer function. But its obvious that 
  the value you get is immutable and hence constant.
